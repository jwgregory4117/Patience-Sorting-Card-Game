# Patience-Sorting-Card-Game

Take a deck of normal playing cards.  The deck is shuffled, cards are turned up one at a time and dealt into piles on the table, according to the following rules:

1.	Initially, there are no piles.  The first card dealt forms a new pile consisting of the single card drawn.

2.	Each new card must be placed on top of the leftmost pile whose top card has a higher value than the new card being added to the piles.

3.	If each of the piles have a top card that is lower than the new card, then the new card must start a new pile to the right of all existing piles.  Thus, you can only place a card on top of a card whose value is higher than its value.

4.	When there are no more cards to deal, the game ends.
